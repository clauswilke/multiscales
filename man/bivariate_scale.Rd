\title{Constructor for bivariate scale object}
\format{An object of class \code{ScaleBivariate} (inherits from \code{Scale}, \code{ggproto}, \code{gg}) of length 17.}
\usage{
bivariate_scale(aesthetics, scale_name, palette, name = waiver(),
  breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(), limits = NULL,
  rescaler1 = rescale, rescaler2 = rescale, oob = censor,
  expand = waiver(), na.value = NA_real_, trans1 = "identity",
  trans2 = "identity", guide = "none", super = ScaleBivariate)
}
\arguments{
\item{aesthetics}{The names of the aesthetics that this scale works with}

\item{scale_name}{The name of the scale}

\item{palette}{A palette function that when called with a single integer
argument (the number of levels in the scale) returns the values that
they should take}

\item{name}{The name of the scale. Used as axis or legend title. If
\code{waiver()}, the default, the name of the scale is taken from the first
mapping used for that aesthetic. If \code{NULL}, the legend title will be
omitted.}

\item{breaks}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no breaks
\item \code{waiver()} for the default breaks computed by the
transformation object
\item A numeric vector of positions
\item A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks
as output
}}

\item{labels}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no labels
\item \code{waiver()} for the default labels computed by the
transformation object
\item A character vector giving labels (must be same length as \code{breaks})
\item A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels
as output
}}

\item{limits}{Data frame with two columns of length two each defining the limits for the two data dimensions.}

\item{rescaler1}{Rescaling function for the first data dimension.}

\item{rescaler2}{Rescaling function for the second data dimension.}

\item{oob}{Function that handles limits outside of the scale limits
(out of bounds). The default replaces out of bounds values with NA.}

\item{expand}{Vector of range expansion constants used to add some
padding around the data, to ensure that they are placed some distance
away from the axes. Use the convenience function \code{\link[=expand_scale]{expand_scale()}}
to generate the values for the \code{expand} argument. The defaults are to
expand the scale by 5\% on each side for continuous variables, and by
0.6 units on each side for discrete variables.}

\item{na.value}{Missing values will be replaced with this value.}

\item{trans1}{Transformation for the first data dimension, given as either the name of a transformation object
or the object itself. See \code{\link[ggplot2:continuous_scale]{ggplot2::continuous_scale()}} for details.}

\item{trans2}{Transformation for the second data dimension. Like \code{trans1}.}

\item{guide}{A function used to create a guide or its name. See
\code{\link[=guides]{guides()}} for more info.}

\item{super}{The super class to use for the constructed scale}
